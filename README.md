### Approxiⅿation Vaⅼue Methods, Tabuⅼar MDP, MC, DQN, Q(λ), SARSA(λ) 

This repository contains my solutions for the second assignment of the Reinforcement Learning course (CE957) at Sharif University of Technology. This assignment consists of two parts: theoretical and practical.

#### Theoretical Part

- **Policy Iteration**: Discusses concepts such as Contraction Mapping, Convergence of Policy Iteration, and Error Bound of Policy Iteration.
- **Gridworld**: Includes problems related to Every Visit Monte Carlo and First Visit Monte Carlo.
- **Optimal Policy**: Analyzes properties of MDP's.
- **Bellman Equation**
- **Temporal Difference and Eligibility Traces**

#### Practical Part

- **RL_PHW2_DQN.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm in the [LunarLander-v2](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/) environment. 
  
- **RL_PHW2_MC_TD.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook covers the implementation of Monte Carlo (MC) and Temporal-Difference (TD) learning algorithms such as Q-learning, Q(λ), SARSA, and SARSA(λ) in the [LunarLander-v2](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/) environment.
